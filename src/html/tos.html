        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: 13th of October 2024</p>

        <p>Welcome! By using our public API and accessing the MP3 files in our archives, you agree to the following terms of service.</p>
        <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>

        <p>We provide a public API that allows users to access MP3 files for archival purposes. The API also provides metadata and file details based on the provided file ID.</p>
        <h2>2. API Key and Usage Limits</h2>

        <p>To use our API, you must obtain an API key. The service is free for up to 10,000 daily requests per user. Exceeding this limit may result in temporary suspension of your API access. We reserve the right to change usage limits or require payment for higher usage in the future. Users found abusing the API key system, such as creating multiple keys to bypass the daily limit, may have their access permanently revoked. We monitor API usage to ensure compliance, and violations will result in immediate termination of access without prior notice.</p>
        <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>

        <p>The files available in our archives are user-generated content. We do not allow new uploads. We only serve existing files. You agree that we are not responsible for the content or any damages resulting from its use.</p>
        <h2>4. DMCA Notice</h2>

        <p>If you believe that any content in our archives infringes upon your copyright, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dmca@picosong.site">dmca@picosong.site</a>. We will review and take appropriate action in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>We are not responsible for any content hosted in our archives. We do not create or control the content provided through our API. All files are provided “as-is” for archival purposes. We disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service.</p>
        <h2>6. No Third-Party Links</h2>

        <p>We do not link to any third-party websites, and we are not responsible for content on external sites that may link to us.</p>
        <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>

        <p>Any disputes arising from your use of the API or this agreement shall be resolved in Poland, within the European Union. Arbitration or other means of dispute resolution may be used, as appropriate.</p>
        <h2>8. Termination</h2>

        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your access to the API at any time for violating these terms or for any other reason at our discretion.</p>
